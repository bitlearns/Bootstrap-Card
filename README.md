# Bootstrap-Card
Three Bootstrap Cards Each Having an Image, Author Name and Download Button in a Responsive Website. The Data is Fetched from an API. Therefore, on every page reload three different images are displaced.

There are many ways to select three different images. But, I used two methods which are discussed below.
1. Three unique random images from a list of 100 images. (commented part in the index.html file from line 23 to 34 and line 39)
2. Any random three consecutive images from a list of 100 images. (line 40,41 and 42 in index.html file)

I have hosted the website on AWS by creating S3 bucket. Click on http://bootstrap-card.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ to visit the website.
